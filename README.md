# AI-Based-Code-Review-Tool-

 AI-Based Code Review Tool involves using natural language processing (NLP) models and static code analysis techniques to review and analyze source code for potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, code quality, and optimization suggestions.
 Project Overview:
Key Features:
Code Analysis: Analyze the code for syntax errors, code smells, or potential issues using static code analysis techniques.
Natural Language Suggestions: Generate suggestions for improving code readability, structure, or best practices using NLP-based AI models.
Security Checks: Review the code for common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, buffer overflow, and XSS.
Integration: Integrate the tool with repositories like GitHub or GitLab for automatic code review during pull requests.
Tools & Libraries:
Python: Primary programming language for backend analysis.
AST (Abstract Syntax Tree): For code parsing and analysis.
Pylint/Flake8: Static code analysis tools.
OpenAI GPT (or other LLM): For NLP-based suggestions and refactoring ideas.
GitHub Actions/Travis CI: For CI/CD integration.
Scikit-learn: For ML-based prediction of code quality issues (optional).
Steps Involved:
Code Parsing and Analysis:

AST (Abstract Syntax Tree): Parse the source code to extract relevant syntax and structural information.
Static Analysis Tools: Use existing static analysis tools like Pylint, Flake8, or Bandit to identify basic issues in the code (e.g., unused variables, naming issues, etc.).
NLP-based Code Review:

Use a language model (like GPT) to generate code quality suggestions.
Fine-tune or prompt the model to provide insights on the quality, readability, and potential improvements in the code.
Security Vulnerability Detection:

Use static analysis or specialized tools like Bandit (for Python) to identify common security flaws.
You can enhance this by training a machine learning model to detect certain types of vulnerabilities based on labeled datasets.
Integration with Git:

Automate the code review tool using GitHub Actions or a similar CI/CD pipeline to trigger code reviews during pull requests.
Project  Steps 
code using AST
import ast

# Sample code for analysis
code = """
def example_function(a, b):
    c = a + b
    return c
"""

# Parse the code using AST
parsed_code = ast.parse(code)

# Walk through the AST
class CodeAnalyzer(ast.NodeVisitor):
    def visit_FunctionDef(self, node):
        print(f"Function Name: {node.name}")
        print(f"Arguments: {[arg.arg for arg in node.args.args]}")
        self.generic_visit(node)

    def visit_Return(self, node):
        print(f"Return Statement: {ast.dump(node)}")

# Analyze the code
analyzer = CodeAnalyzer()
analyzer.visit(parsed_code)

#AI drien suggestions using gpt 
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

# Load GPT model for code suggestions
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")

def suggest_improvement(code_snippet):
    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(code_snippet, return_tensors='pt')
    outputs = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=150, num_return_sequences=1)
    
    suggestion = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return suggestion

# Provide a code snippet for analysis
code_snippet = """
def check_even(num):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return True
    return False
"""

# Get suggestion from GPT model
suggestion = suggest_improvement(code_snippet)
print(f"Suggested Improvement:\n{suggestion}")
